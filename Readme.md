First we need to run the v_plot3.py by giving the command "zcat mapped.bed.gz | python v_plot3.py" this will generate a matrix_output3.txt file which will 
 v_plot.gnu .This matrix file is of long type and contains point values for x,y and z axis.Then we have to give command "gnuplot v_plot.gnu" which will 
create a plot.png file.
